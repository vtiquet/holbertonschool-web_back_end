## ⚙️ General Requirements

All projects in this repository adhere to the following general standards:

  * **Environment:** Files are compiled and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
  * **Python:** Scripts are written in **Python 3.8** and adhere to the **PyCode Style (PEP 8)**.
  * **Documentation:** Modules, classes, and functions are documented with clear docstrings.
  * **Type Checking:** Projects extensively use Python's type annotations and the `mypy` tool for static type checking.
  * **Shebang:** Python scripts include the correct shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`).
